        "answer": "Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 0 to 1. Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred, denoted by P(A|B).",

        "answer": "The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution. It is significant because it justifies the use of normal distribution in many statistical procedures.",

It is used in hypothesis testing to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis; a low p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.",

        "answer": "A normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, with data near the mean more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. It is important because many statistical tests assume normality, and it models many natural phenomena.",
